**GABETROLL/GABETROLL** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on A 3D Tetris game, as my Holberton School Portfolio Project
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to manage myself and my Sotfware Engineering career at Hoberton
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything cool! :)
